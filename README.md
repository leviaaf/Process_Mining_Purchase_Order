# Process Mining Data Analysis with SAP HANA

This project focuses on processing event log data using SAP HANA for process mining analysis. The project involves five main stages: creating a master table, identification, cleaning, partitioning, and analysis.

## 1. Create Table Master

In this step, a master table is created in SAP HANA to store the event log data. The structure of the table is designed to accommodate the necessary attributes for further analysis.

## 2. Identification

The identification stage involves identifying the key elements and attributes within the event log data, such as activities, timestamps, case IDs, and other relevant information.

## 3. Cleaning

Data cleaning is performed to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the event log data. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any anomalies in the data.

## 4. Partitioning

Partitioning the data into suitable segments or subsets based on specific criteria is carried out to facilitate efficient analysis and improve performance.

## 5. Analysis

In the analysis stage, various process mining techniques and algorithms are applied to extract valuable insights from the event log data. This includes discovering process models, identifying patterns, and evaluating process performance metrics.
